# Appsilon task recruitmant - Enterprise shiny dashboard

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for the chance to make this project - I had a lot of fun! :)

To do this challenge, I had to use HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

## The task

My challenge was to build an "Enterprise shiny dashboard" and get it looking as close to the design as possible but I didn't have to implement it exactly the same as in the mockup.

I decided to do this without the use of frameworks. I used pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

My assumptions:
- Good quality codebase,
- Viewing the optimal layout, depending on the device's screen size,
- Showing hover states for all interactive elements on the page,
- Availability of dark mode.

I made this project in a desktop-first way.

I tested this on:
- Safari 14.0,
- Firefox 81.0.2,
- Google Chrome 86.0.4240.111.

## Project deployment
I decided to put the project to my GitHub Pages repository.  
It's available live: https://dczerniawko.github.io/sandbox/enterprise-shiny-dashboard-appsilon/
